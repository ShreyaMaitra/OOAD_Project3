# UML Changes
We are considering Staff and Vehicle as the abstract class . In project 2 we had not considered Vehicle also as an abstract class.
getVehicleAddon() is the method used for Decorator Pattern. writeToFile() method is used for the Observer pattern. doWash() method is used for the Strategy Pattern.

# Assumptions : 

We are starting the simulation considering that there are three types of staffs of each type Intern, Salerperson, Mechanic, Driver. 
Also we are considering that the inventory has 10 Vehicles of each type. The store vehicle stock has 4 of each types of Cars i.e. Regular Cars, Pick Up Cars, Performance Cars, Electric Cars, Monster Trucks, Motorcycles. Also we are considering that one sales person can sell multiple cars. Also it is likely that one of each type of Mechanic, Salesperson, Intern can quit and Injured Drivers leave. Buyer can have only one addon.
